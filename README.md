## Technology Stack & Tools 

Ray's Kitchen implements the PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React/Redux, Node.js) stack.


**Frontend**

_React Redux_ was used to manage our applications state.

**Backend**

_PostgreSql_ was used as our DBMS. This allowed us to use a common set of data points thru a relational database. To interface with our database, we used _Express_ and _Node_ to establish our server and API routes.


## Local Setup

We used the [_FS-App-Template_](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/fs-app-template.git) boilermaker as the base of our project and built off of it.

```
  npm install
```

```
  npm run start
```
